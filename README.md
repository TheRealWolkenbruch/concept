# AreYouThere

## Description

This project is part of the [EU vs Virus Hackathon](https://euvsvirus.org/)
We are Team "[Wolkenbruch](https://github.com/TheRealWolkenbruch/)"

Let’s create an app to “silently” protect people in violent households or elder citizens. A “dead man’s switch” is a switch that raises an alarm (in this case for example in a non-profit/social organization or in some social/welfare authority office), if it has not been pressed after a certain interval. The idea is to enforce regular feedback to those who need a bit of surveillance and protection, if the feedback is not coming, help can be sent or at least calls can be made.

This app is called AreYouThere.

Technical: Modern open source Web-App with backend & frontend, easy to deploy, mobile-friendly/first.
Extension points: Android/iPhone app with more functionality.

Needs: Frontend Devs, Backend Devs, Ops, Mobile Devs, POs


# Next Meetings

* Throughout Friday already in our [Slack Room](https://euvsvirus.slack.com/archives/C012AS1TR36)
* Saturday we plan to start hacking at around 10:00.

# Scope of the project

We want to define (and limit) the scope of our implementation. The scope of the
limitation defines the technical architecture.

The scope of the project can be defined through user stories. Those user
stories can be turned into tickets. The tickets can then be turned into code.

* [User Stories](/UserStories.md)

# Next Steps

* Derive Issues/Tasks from the User Stories
* Derive an overall Architecture that covers all requirements from the Tasks
* Define Apps & Repositories & tech stack from the architecture + tasks
* Assign Tasks and work on them


# TODOs

* Defintion of the (sub-)project & features - i.e. what to do and what not to do
* Define Architecture & Technologies
* Next Steps
