# AreYouThere

## Description

This project is part of the [EU vs Virus Hackathon](https://euvsvirus.org/)
We are Team "[Wolkenbruch](https://github.com/TheRealWolkenbruch/)"

Let’s create an app to “silently” protect people in violent households or elder citizens. A “dead man’s switch” is a switch that raises an alarm (in this case for example in a non-profit/social organization or in some social/welfare authority office), if it has not been pressed after a certain interval. The idea is to enforce regular feedback to those who need a bit of surveillance and protection, if the feedback is not coming, help can be sent or at least calls can be made.

This app is called AreYouThere.

Technical: Modern open source Web-App with backend & frontend, easy to deploy, mobile-friendly/first.

Extension points: Android/iPhone app with more functionality.

Needs: Frontend Devs, Backend Devs, Ops, Mobile Devs, POs
